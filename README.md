# Node-Authentication-Project

- Authentication means that not every visitor of the page can view and interact with everything.
- Authentication has to happen on the server-side and builds up on sessions.
- You can protect routes by checking the (session-controlled) login status right before you access a controller action.

## Lessons Learned

When I did this project that's time I learned about JavaScript, NodeJs,
 ExpressJs, HTML, CSS, PUG, Handlebars, EJS, SQL, Sequealize, MongoDb and Mongoose DataBase. One
  more thing Here **"npm"** is the most vital thing that's why I also go
   through the **npm** official website and learned from there.
